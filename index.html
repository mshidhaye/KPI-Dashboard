          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            H&C Inc is a new call center that recently opened in Austin, Texas. I was hired as a Tableau Consultant to
            analyze their employee KPIs. The KPIs allow stakeholders to monitor progress, identify trends, and create an
            expansion plan for 2024.
          </p>

          <h3>Business Questions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>How does call volume vary during the week?</li>
            <li>What are the patterns in inbound calls and call duration?</li>
            <li>Which employees resolve the most calls?</li>
            <li>What is the overall resolution rate across employees?</li>
            <li>How efficient is the team’s speed of answer?</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>About the Data</h3>
          <p>
            Eight employees were randomly selected from various departments, and their performance was analyzed for call
            resolution, customer satisfaction, and speed of answer. About 5,000 calls were analyzed on these parameters.
          </p>

          <h3>Tools Used</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Excel – Data Cleaning</li>
            <li>Tableau – Visualization</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Daily inbound calls showed steady activity throughout the week, with slight peaks midweek and the highest
              on Mondays. The average call duration provided insight into employee efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two employees consistently achieved a higher number of resolved calls compared to their peers. A bar chart
              featuring the number of calls was very useful to narrow down high achievers.
            </li>
            <li>
              The resolution rate exceeded the team’s average benchmark, showing effective problem-solving across most
              employees.
            </li>
            <li>
              The team maintained a speed of answer above 60%, meaning more than half of incoming calls were answered
              promptly within the target timeframe.
            </li>
            <li>
              Customer satisfaction ratings averaged 4+ on a 5-point scale, showing a strong positive response to call
              handling quality.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Recommendations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Staffing:</b> Allocate more agents to Mondays and high-volume periods. Employee start times should be
              staggered during the day to provide maximum coverage. Offer in-person, hybrid, and remote options to
              retain employees.
            </li>
            <li><b>Training:</b> Share best practices from top performers to boost team-wide resolution rates.</li>
            <li><b>Monitoring:</b> Track daily satisfaction and speed of answer metrics to maintain responsiveness.</li>
            <li><b>Process Optimization:</b> Continue analyzing call duration to balance speed and quality.</li>
          </ul>
