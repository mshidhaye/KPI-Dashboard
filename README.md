  <h3>Business Questions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>How does call volume vary during the week?</li>
    <li>What are the patterns in inbound calls and call duration?</li>
    <li>Which employees resolve the most calls?</li>
    <li>What is the overall resolution rate across employees?</li>
	<li>How efficient is the team’s speed of answer?</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>About the Data</h3>
  <p>
    8 employees were randomly selected from various departments and their performance was analyzed as per call resolution, customer satisfaction and Speed of answer. About 5000 calls were analyzed on these parameters.
  </p>

  <h3>Tools Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Excel</b> – Data Cleaning</li>
    <li><b>Tableau</b> – Data Exploration & Visualization</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Insights</h3>
  <li>Daily inbound calls showed steady activity throughout the week, with slight peaks midweekand highest on Mondays. The average call duration provided insight 
      into employee efficiency.</li>
  <li> Two employees consistently achieved a higher number of resolved calls compared to their peers.Bar chart featuring number of calls was very useful to narrow high 
      achievers.</li>
  <li> The resolution rate exceeded the team’s average benchmark, showing effective problem-solving across most employees.</li>
  <li>The team maintained a speed of answer above 60%, meaning more than half of incoming calls were answered promptly within the target timeframe.</li>
  <li>Customer satisfaction ratings averaged 4+ on a 5-point scale, showing a strong positive response to call handling quality.</li>

  <h3>Recommendations</h3>
  <li>Staffing: Allocate more agents to Mondays and high-volume periods. Employee start times should be staggered during the day to provide maximum coverage.Offer 
      in-person, hybrid and remote options to the employees to retain employees. </li>
  <li>Training: Share best practices from top performers to boost team-wide resolution rates.</li>
  <li>Monitoring: Track daily satisfaction and speed of answer metrics to maintain responsiveness.</li>
  <li>Process Optimization: Continue analyzing call duration to balance speed and quality.</li>


  </ul>
